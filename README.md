## New York Citi Bike data visualizations for August 2019


- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.
- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.

## August Peak Hours

- The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.
- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.

## Summary

The vast majority of the rides were taken by male riders during morning and evening rush hours on Manhattan Island, which is quite congested. This means that commuting workers use Citi Bike services as an alternative to public transportation. The data shows that the bike-sharing programme in New York had a lot of activity in August 2019.
